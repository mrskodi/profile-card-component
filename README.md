# profile-card-component

Notes:
My first project all on my own without any tutorial.
Satisfaction on the outcome: 70%

Learnings from this assignment:

1. Steps that go into understanding the design, the layout and how to structure html to best represent the design.
2. How to effectively position background images using position: absolute and relative.
3. How to center an element without using flexbox - Used position absolute, top and left 50% and translate: transform(-50%, -50%)

Need clarifications on the following:

1. Mobile view - my design seems to be off in the mob view. How to fix this?
2. When shrinking the height, how to make the card responsive - specifically how to make the text responsive.
3. We are given the mobile and the desktop widths - what shoud I do with that data? Used max-width: 1440px;
